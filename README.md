# nosql-challenge

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data files for the NoSQL Challenge, which involves analyzing data from the UK Food Standards Agency. The goal of this challenge is to evaluate various food establishments across the United Kingdom and provide insights for food critics and journalists to focus on future articles.

## Setup

To get started with the challenge, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies. Ensure that you have Python and MongoDB installed on your system.
3. Import the data provided in the "establishments.json" file into your local MongoDB database. Name the database `uk_food` and the collection "establishments". The data includes information about various food establishments in the UK, such as their names, locations, ratings, and more.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook "NoSQL_setup_starter_ipynb" to start analyzing the data and completing the challenge tasks.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files and directories:

- "NoSQL_Analysis_starter.ipynb": Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and completing the challenge tasks.
- "NoSQL_Analysis_starter.ipynb": Jupyter Notebook for data setuo and completing the challenge tasks.
- "establishments.json": JSON file containing the data about UK food establishments. This data will be imported into the MongoDB database.

## Data Analysis

In the Jupyter Notebook, you will find code snippets and explanations for each of the challenge tasks. The data analysis involves tasks such as:

- Importing the data into MongoDB and setting up the database connection.
- Verifying the data and collections in the database.
- Retrieving and manipulating data using MongoDB queries and aggregation pipelines.
- Converting data types and cleaning the data.
- Analyzing and visualizing the data to draw meaningful insights.

## Conclusion

The NoSQL Challenge aims to leverage MongoDB's features to analyze and understand the UK Food Standards Agency data. By completing the tasks in the Jupyter Notebook, you will gain valuable experience in working with NoSQL databases and using Python libraries for data analysis.
